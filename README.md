# ONT-DMS

ONT-DMS is a Nextflow pipeline for processing barcoded protein variant libraries and [NestLink libraries](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0389-8) sequenced by nanopore sequencing.
Reads are binned according to their barcodes or flycodes (UMIs).
Accurate consensus sequences are calculated using Dorado polish.
Finally, variants are called with the pipeline, linking barcodes or flycodes with their respective protein variants.

> [!NOTE]
> Tested on macOS 15.7 (Mamba), Windows 11 (WSL with Docker), and Ubuntu 22.04 (Mamba, Apptainer).

## Requirements
### Local execution

- Nextflow ([Installation guide](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/install.html)).
- Mamba/ Conda ([https://conda-forge.org/](https://conda-forge.org/)) or Docker
- Dorado ([Installation guide](https://software-docs.nanoporetech.com/dorado/latest/#installation)), does not have to be installed when using containers.

### Cluster execution

- Slurm workflow manager
- Nextflow, installed in a Mamba/ Conda environment called `nextflow`. 
- Mamba/ Conda or Apptainer
- Dorado

> [!TIP]
> Add dorado to your PATH e.g. by adding `export PATH="$PATH:/home/fackle/data/dorado-1.2.0-linux-x64/bin"` to your `.bashrc`.

## Running the pipeline

1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/fabianackle/ONT-DMS.git`.
2. Check the nextflow configuration file `nextflow.config`.
3. Create a `params.json` file with the parameters listed below, specify the nanopore reads (BAM) and reference sequence, see the examples contained in this repo.
4. Run the pipeline with either `./run_NL-pipeline.sh` for local execution or on a cluster with `sbatch run_NL-pipeline.slurm`.

> [!TIP]
> The pipeline can also be run directly: `nextflow run main.nf -profile conda -params-file params.json`.

† for multiple BAM files use `*`, e.g. `data/barcode*.bam`.
†2 see [Linked adapters (combined 5’ and 3’ adapter)](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html#linked-adapters).
†3 do not use if you want to use move tables, as currently there are no models that support both.
